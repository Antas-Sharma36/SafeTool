This is actually a keylogger created by 3vilp4wn called CryptLog.
This whole repository is actually a test to see whether github flags a keylogger or will let it go right under its nose.

This is a huge issue in github. 

There are many malware repositories on github that explicitly declare their objective.

But, if I upload this repository pretending to be a safe tool ( and not a keylogger ), Github won't even put a warning.
I.e. it doesn't verify the purpose the repository.

Now, this program uses only php and python and I understand these languages - so, I can easily analyze this program
and conclude that this actually a keylogger.

However, if this was written in some language that I don't know about, then I would have been fooled very easily and installed this keylogger.
Or, if someone is looking for a tool on github and there aren't too many of them and the tools aren't popular.
Or, I am in a hurry and I have to rely on a tool - I wouldn't even check this tool.

All these situations will result in me getiting pwned. 
Why this problem hasn't been addressed yet is a mystery to me.
But, the bigger question here is - how many Github users have been pwned in this way.

This repository is a part of my research on this problem statement.

Btw, don't worry - I have removed the build instructions for this program so you wouldn't be able to harm yourself.
This is actually completely safe unless you figure out how to run this.

This keylogger was created by 3vilp4wn.
